## NUET - PSCT - CRITICAL THINKING - ARGUMENT FLAWS

### TEXT:
The 21st century is witnessing a significant rise in the proportion of people being diagnosed by medical professionals as having a mental illness. For example, at the turn of the century, the number of Canadians being treated for depression increased by over 30% in just one year. A recent study in the US found that nearly twice the number of young people there were diagnosed with a mental disorder in 2018 as compared to 2003. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2028, depression will be the second leading type of disability worldwide. It is clear that aspects of the modern world make it more difficult for people to maintain good mental health.
